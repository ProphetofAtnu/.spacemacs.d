# My .spacemacs.d Configs

## Why is this on GitHub? 

When I initially started using Spacemacs, I had very little understanding of how Emacs, let alone Emacs Lisp, worked. Now, I at least can do more than set a few variables.

## Installation

```sh
git clone github.com/ProphetofAtnu/.spacemacs.d.git ~/.spacemacs.d
```
